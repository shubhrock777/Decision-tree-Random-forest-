#Decision Tree

#A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes causes high sale. 

#A decision tree can be built with target variable Sale (we will first convert it in categorical variable) & all other variable will be independent in the analysis.

#Lets see how we Build the Model Now
#As we Know that we have to build a Decision Tree with the Dependent Variable as Sale
#But Sale is a Numeric Value
#So first Lets Convert the Sales Variable into a Categorical Variable

#When we got the Summary of the Dataset, we Saw that the Sales variable has a range of 0 to 16
#So here We will Split the Variable
#we will create a new variale "High"
#If the Sales is Greater than 8 then It is a Yes Else No

High <- ifelse(Sales > 8,"Yes","No")
High <- as.factor(High)

#Lets Combine it With the Main Dataset
company_new <- cbind(company[,-1], High) #Here we Exclude the Sales Column as we have Derived a responsive Variable High using it

#Lets Create the Training and Testing sets
indatapartition <- createDataPartition(company_new$High, p=.70, list = F) #This will Hold 70% of the whole dataset
training <- company_new[indatapartition,]
testing <- company_new[-indatapartition,]

#Lets Fit the Model for Entire Data Now
